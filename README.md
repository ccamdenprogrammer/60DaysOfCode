# 60DaysOfCode

The goal of this coding challenge is not to teach you to code, but rather to help you strengthen your current skills as a developer. Think of it more like a workout rather than a bootcamp. I am well aware that to be able to cover everything in this list in 60 days will NOT be easy. If it was, I wouldn't call it a "challenge" ;). Regardless, I will be updating this ReadMe file with a daily journal entry to track my progress. I will also be commiting a folder every day that contains a daily journal entry, any problems/projects I worked on, and all of the resources I utilized. I aim for this to be somewhat of a "portfolio" or at the very least, a digital notebook to have as a reference for both myself (you too if you follow along) and potential employers. While this is a personal project, I encourage you to follow along and share your progress! 

Always feel free to contact me with any suggestions.
