# 60DaysOfCode

The goal of this coding challenge is not to teach you to code, but rather to help you strengthen your current skills as a developer. Think of it more like a workout rather than a bootcamp. I am well aware that to be able to cover everything in this list in 60 days will NOT be easy. If it was, I wouldn't call it a "challenge" ;). Regardless, I will be updating this ReadMe file with a daily journal entry to track my progress. I will also be commiting a folder every day that contains a daily journal entry, any problems/projects I worked on, and all of the resources I utilized. I aim for this to be somewhat of a "portfolio" or at the very least, a digital notebook to have as a reference for both myself (you too if you follow along) and potential employers. While this is a personal project, I encourage you to follow along and share your progress! 

Another thing to note is that you are more than welcome, and encouraged to use multiple languages! I will be using c++ for the majority of things here, but the goal of this project is to help cement the IDEAS of important programming concepts, not laguage specific issues. Anything here can be applied to the language you choose to use.

Always feel free to contact me with any suggestions.

# Day 1
While the first day of this challenge is mostly a review, I feel that revisiting arrays and understanding them on a deeper level is one of, if not the most important topics to get down pat on anyone's computer science jourey. To practice arrays, I've solved three array-based LeetCode problems. These are problems that I have solved before, but this time I really took the time time priortize getting an EFFICENT solution, rather than just getting one that works. Today was an easy day, but I have posted all of my LeetCode solutions and their explainations in the day 1 folder. See you tommorow!
